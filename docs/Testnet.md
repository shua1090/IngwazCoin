# Testnet

The Testnet is where all public transactions take place, and is also where the network is tested.
Early versions of the testnet will be continuously revised, so any currency you have is not final, and
the developers of Ingwaz bear no responsibility for currency loss. Later revisions of Ingwaz
will be more refined, without the testnet being turned off or on for feature testing.
The Testnet is also called Ingawz-Alpha. The centralized Node is currently being setup,
so please remain patient. Note: Testnet may Initially restrict access due to Node security 
concerns (Port-Forwarding).
