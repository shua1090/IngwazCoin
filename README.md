# Ingwaz Coin #

![Alt text](src/main/resources/IngwazSmall.png?raw=true "Logo")<br/>
Ingwaz is an attempt to create a new, simple-to-understand cryptocurrency, implementing the basic concepts behind a
BlockChain in Java. The cryptocurrency is not designed for large-scale use, and is more suitable for a 'reward' system
within a somewhat small (less than 100,000 people) group. The fundamental concept of a BlockChain is used, but other
security implementations found in famous Currencies may not be utilized (Implementation is more important than security
for this project)

## Status

- A method of organizing Blocks, verifying their validity, and keeping a list of current balances has been developed. A
  Mining (PoW) system has also been completed.
- A networking toolkit for communicating with a Server (or p2p in the future) is currently being designed
- An easily accessible GUI for Wallets and viewing the BlockChain is also in the works

## Current Coin Details

Subject to change until release 1.0<br />

  More contributors always welcome! A BlockChain in Java, written and documented by students, should be entertaining in
  the least!
